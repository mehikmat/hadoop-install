x.x.x.x worker1
x.x.x.x worker2
```
3) Install Java in all machines

4) Add known hosts foreach masters to workers
```
for each masters
   do ssh-keyscan -f workers.txt >> ~/.ssh/know_hosts
   
for each workers
   do ssh-keyscan -f masters.txt >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

5) Install hadoop in all the machines

6) Install zookeepr in all the machines(optional)
